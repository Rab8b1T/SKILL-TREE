## Tips & Tricks

### Maximizing Score
1. Solve easier problems first (A, B, C)
2. Minimize time spent on each problem
3. Avoid wrong submissions (5 min penalty each)
4. Monitor the timer and score decay

### Contest Strategy
1. **Quick scan**: Read all problems first (2-3 minutes)
2. **Identify easy ones**: Start with problems you're confident about
3. **Time management**: Don't spend too long on one problem
4. **Penalty awareness**: Test your code thoroughly before submitting

### Using Custom Contests
1. **Rating range**: Start with narrower ranges for consistent difficulty
2. **Topic selection**: Focus on topics you want to practice
3. **Problem count**: Fewer problems (4-6) for focused practice
4. **Duration**: Adjust based on your available time

### Tracking Progress
1. **Regular contests**: Try to do 2-3 contests per week
2. **Division progression**: Start with DIV4, move up as you improve
3. **Analytics**: Review your performance graphs regularly
4. **Patterns**: Identify which problem types you struggle with
